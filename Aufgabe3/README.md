My files for the 3rd Assignment of the Geosoftware 1 course

The website lets you get your own coordinates as GeoJSON, input your own GeoJSON (single Point in a FeatureCollection), use the standard point
and upload your own GeoJSON file (single Point in a FeatureCollection) to show the nearest bus stops and the needed information coming with them such as 
bus line nummer, end stop, depature time and date, name of the bus stop, distance to the bus stops from the point used by the user
and the coordinates of the bus stop.

Be aware of the bus depature, or you might miss it ;)
