My files for the 4th Assignment of the Geosoftware 1 course

The website lets you get your own coordinates as GeoJSON, input your own GeoJSON (single Point in a FeatureCollection), use the standard point
and upload your own GeoJSON file (single Point in a FeatureCollection) to show the nearest bus stops and the needed information coming with them such as 
bus line nummer, end stop, depature time and date, name of the bus stop, distance to the bus stops from the point used by the user
and the coordinates of the bus stop.

Now, in addition it shows you all bus stops on a leaflet map with the same information shown as popups that is given in the table and it also let's you draw your own rectangle in which the bus stops are then being shown

(this only works in the beginning at the moment, before operating the textarea, standard and uploaded point buttons)
